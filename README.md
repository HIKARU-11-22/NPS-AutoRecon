# Auto Reconciliation Tool (Python)

## Overview
This project is a **Python-based Auto Reconciliation program** created to simplify and speed up reconciliation tasks within the company I currently work for.

I am **not part of the technical/development team** at the company. This tool was **self-initiated** and developed independently to make my own work easier and more efficient. Over time, it has also helped my colleagues reduce manual effort and save time during reconciliation activities.

The project was **not officially assigned** to me as part of my role—it was built out of personal interest and a desire to improve workflow efficiency.

## Purpose
Manual reconciliation is often time-consuming and repetitive. The goal of this project is to:
- Reduce manual effort
- Minimize human error
- Improve speed and consistency in reconciliation tasks
- Make daily operational work easier and more efficient

---

## Features
- Automated reconciliation using Python
- Handles structured data files (e.g., CSV/Excel – adjust as applicable)
- Identifies mismatches and matched records
- Generates output results for review
- Improves turnaround time compared to manual reconciliation

> ⚠️ Note: This tool is **not perfect** and may require manual validation in certain scenarios.

---

## Limitations
- Built as a practical, working solution—not a production-grade system
- May not handle all edge cases
- Requires clean and properly formatted input data
- Further optimization and testing are needed for large-scale use

---

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** (Add libraries used, e.g., pandas, streamlit, etc.)

---

## Motivation
This project was created to:
- Improve personal productivity
- Learn and apply Python in real-world scenarios
- Solve a real business problem through automation
- Help colleagues work more efficiently

---

## Disclaimer
- This project is **not an official company product**
- Developed independently and voluntarily
- Intended for internal productivity and learning purposes only
- Does not expose or include sensitive or confidential company data

---

## Future Improvements
- Better error handling
- Improved performance for large datasets
- User-friendly interface (CLI or GUI)
- More configurable reconciliation rules
- Logging and reporting enhancements
