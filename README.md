# Auto Reconciliation System (Python)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **Python-based Auto Reconciliation Program** developed to support the reconciliation process within the company I am currently working with.  
Although I am **not part of the core technical team**, this project was independently designed and implemented to improve efficiency, accuracy, and automation in reconciliation tasks.

The primary goal of this system is to **automate manual reconciliation activities**, reduce human error, and save operational time.
